## Features

#### Two game types
* Player VS Player - in this game type, two players play together
* PLayer VS AI - in this game type, player paly with AI

## Setup
If you want to run this app you have to install two packages - `scikit-learn` and `customtkinter` because `customtkinter` is not campatible with `pyinstaller`, so I can't create an .exe file.
You can do it with pip method by typing `pip install scikit-learn customtkinter` cammand in system console.
After that you have to run `main.py` file using e.g. `python C:\Users\User\Path\To\Program\Folder\AI-Connect-four\main.py` command in system console.

## Future New Features
I'm planning to add the history of the games played with data, result, winner etc.
